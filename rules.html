						<p class="lead">How It Works:</p>
								<p><h7>1. Form Project Teams Online

You can form and join project teams by browsing <a href="http://challengepost.com/lexhacks/">Challengepost</a>.</p></h7>

<p><h7>2. Submit Solutions to Challenges

Submit solutions to challenges by 3:00 p.m. local time on June 7, 2015, to qualify to win sponsor 

prizes.</p></h7><br/>
<p class="lead">Rules:</p>
<p><h7>1. <strong>Teams</strong>

Participants should form teams of 2 to 5 people. Participants may participate remotely, but at least one team 

member must be present to submit solutions to challenges.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>2. <strong>Fresh Code</strong>

To ensure a level field for all contestants, everyone must start coding at the same time—10am 

local time on June 6, 2015. Before this time, you are free to work on your design, logo, 

wireframes, idea validation, make digital mockups, etc., but no coding can be done beforehand. 

This allows you to spend your time at LexHacks doing what you love best – Hacking! The only 

exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public. Some 

examples of this would be: public domain images, creative commons music, and open source 

libraries. We take this rule very seriously for the sake of all members attending the event. 

Failure to comply may result in the offending team’s disqualification.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>3. <strong>Build on Technology Designated in Sponsor Challenge (if designated)</strong>

Teams will build on the technology of the sponsors for the particular challenge participants

accept.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>4. <strong>It’s Okay to Hack! Use APIs, Services, and Open Source</strong>

Feel free to use any tools, tricks, gems, frameworks, 3rd party services, APIs, open source 

projects, libraries, or workarounds you’ve discovered over the years to help you build quicker. 

Use any language, hosting service, etc. you please.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>5. <strong>Ownership and IP</strong>
Just being a team member at the hackathon does not mean that you get to own any code or IP that your 

teammates (or the audience) produce in the future based on the idea. Any ideas you pitch or 

share at the hackathon are released into the ‘public domain’ and we do not require attendees to 

sign non-disclosure agreements. It’s a hackathon; if you’re worried about people stealing your 

startup idea, this might not be the right place to unveil it.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>6. <strong>Alcohol</strong>

There will be no alcohol served or allowed at the event.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>7. <strong>Be Respectful</strong>

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember

that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. Please see our 

hackathon policies below.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>8. <strong>Submissions</strong>

Each hack will have a unique <a href="http://challengepost.com/lexhacks/">Challengepost</a> page and each team must submit their project by

3:00 p.m. on Sunday, June 7, 2015.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>9. <strong>Main Stage Pitches</strong>

The top two or more submissions for each challenge will be asked to pitch their solutions on the

main stage. Sponsors will pick the top submissions.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>10. <strong>Prizes</strong>

All prizes will be sponsor prizes. Sponsors will choose their own prizes and choose their own

prize winners at the conclusion of Day 2 of the legal hackathon. Sponsors may delegate any 

person to choose prize winners.</p></h7><br/>
<p><h7>11. <strong>Have fun, it’s a hackathon.</strong>

Hack, meet new people, get creative, and have a good time. Use whatever languages or hacks

you have in your arsenal. Show us hardware. Show us new concepts. Show us anything you’d 

like.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7>Getting something meaningful done within such a short amount of time can be stressful, but 

we’d like to encourage everyone to take a break every now and then to relax and enjoy the 

event.</h7></p><br/>
<p id="faq" class="lead">FAQ</p>
<p><h5>Who can participate in the hackathon?</h5></p>
<p><h7>The 2015 LexHacks hackathon is open to any registered attendee to participate. You can be a developer,

designer, lawyer, law student, biz dev person, idea person, or anything in between.</p></h7><br/>


<p><h5>What types of projects can hackathon teams work on?</h5></p>
<p><h7>Hackathon teams can work on any type of project (web apps, mobile apps, wearable solutions, data

visualizations, algorithms, even video presentations or visual mock-ups) however all of the hackathon 

prizes are sponsored prizes for teams that best utilize sponsor technology. Most of these sponsor 

technologies are only relevant for web and mobile applications, and we expect that 95%+ of teams will 

end up building web and mobile applications.</p></h7>

<p><h5>How do I form a hackathon team?</h5></p>
<p><h7>You can form a hackathon team before the hackathon (either with friends / co-workers or you can find

team members and projects on the <a href="http://challengepost.com/lexhacks/">Challengepost</a> app). Many participants will find teams at the hackathon 

kick-off (Saturday at 9:00 a.m.). Only project admins can add team members to their team via the 

application, and they can add team members until Sunday at 10:00 a.m.</p></h7>

<p><h5>How do project teams get judged?</h5></p>
<p><h7>When it comes to winning a sponsor’s prize, your team is responsible for demoing the project to the 

sponsor between 3:30 and 5:00 p.m. local time on Sunday. Sponsors are solely responsible for choosing 

which teams win their prizes. You get 3 minutes to pitch your solution. After each team has had 3 minutes 

to pitch its solution, sponsors may call back teams for additional time, at their discretion. If the sponsor is 

one that will be calling teams to pitch on the main stage, a winner will be announced after the main-stage 

pitches. Solutions will be judged on a variety of factors, including 1) Progress on the solution 2) 

Communication of the idea and 3) Would this make a viable innovative startup that could grow into a 

company? Sponsors have the sole discretion to choose prize winners.</p></h7>

<p><h5>Who owns the technology that hackathon teams produce?</h5></p>
<p><h7>The teams that work on the projects retain any rights they might otherwise have obtained in any new IP

that they develop, however ‘just being a team member’ at the hackathon does not mean that you get to 

own any code or IP that your teammates (or the audience) produce in the future based on the idea. Any 

ideas pitched or shared at the hackathon are released into the public domain as open source. No one at 

the legal hackathon is required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. If you are worried about people 

stealing your startup idea, this might not be the right place to unveil it.</p></h7>

<p><h5>Does the hackathon, its sponsors, or mentors provide any

assistance to teams?</h5></p>
<p><h7>Many sponsors will be available to help you with your project (even if you’re not using their technology). 

You can contact the sponsors directly online through <a href="http://challengepost.com/lexhacks/">Challengepost</a>. Mentors will also be available to help.</p></h7>

<p><h5>Hackathon Anti-Harassment & Intellectual

Property Policy</h5></p>
<p><h7>We also ask all participants to be in compliance with the Hack Code of Conduct Terms.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>All hackathon participants are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will 

enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe 

environment for everybody.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>Please report any incidents or concerns to the event staff.</p></h7>

<p><h5>I. Code of Conduct</h5></p>
<p><h7>We fully support appropriate behavior by all participants at technical events, including all hackathon 

conferences. We expect all attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers, and staff to help us make the 

hackathon a place that welcomes and respects all participants, regardless of race, gender, age, sexual 

orientation, disability, physical appearance, national origin, ethnicity, or religion. We will not tolerate 

harassment of conference participants in person, online, or in any other form.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, overly sexualized 

images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption 

of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>We expect all participants—attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers—to follow the Code of 

Conduct during the hackathon. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in 

related online communities and social media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are 

expected to comply immediately.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>We thank our participants for your help in keeping the event welcoming, respectful, and friendly to all 

participants.</p></h7></br>

<p><h5>II. Anti-Harassment</h5></p>
<p><h7>Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. Harassment

includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical 

appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate 

intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, 

sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual 

attention. Overly sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including 

hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to refuse being 

photographed. If they object to being photographed, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take 

photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy e.g. in bathrooms or 

where participants are sleeping.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>Hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Sponsors, partners, exhibitors, and volunteers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In 

particular, sponsors should not use overly sexualized images, activities, or other material. Sponsor 

representatives should not use overly sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a 

sexualized environment.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being 

harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a 

member of hackathon staff immediately. Hackathon staff will happily help participants contact any local 

security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to 

feel safe for the duration of the hackathon.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a

refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organizers. If a participant engages in harassing 

behavior, the hackathon organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the 

offender or expulsion from the hackathon with no refund.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related 

social events. We value your attendance.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>Please report any incidents or concerns to the event staff.</p></h7></br>

<p><h5>III. Intellectual Property Policy</h5></p>
<p><h7><em>Intellectual Property Rights</h7></em></p></br>
<p><h7>Upon submitting a solution, participants and sponsors agree that new intellectual property created in connection with the legal 

hackathon shall become part of the public domain and available as open source.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7>LexHacks and its agents, organizers, and representatives make no representations or warranties with 

respect to the intellectual property of the attendees, participants, sponsors, or any other individual 

affiliated in any way with the hackathon.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7><em>Protection of Intellectual Property</h7></em></p></br>
<p><h7>By submitting a hackathon entry or accepting any prize, participants represent and warrant the following: 

1) participants will not submit content that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret, or otherwise subject 

to third-party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, 

unless the participant is the owner of such rights or has permission from the rightful owner to post the 

content and to grant the hackathon all of the rights granted herein; 2) the participant will not publish 

falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage the hackathon, its sponsors, or any third party; 3) 

the participant will not submit content that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, 

pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, encourages criminal activity, gives rise to 

civil liability, or is otherwise inappropriate or destructive to the hackathon's or sponsors' brand image or 

goodwill; 4) the participant will not post advertisements or solicitations of business; 5) the hackathon will 

not be obligated to pay any compensation to, or permit any participation by, any third party in connection 

with the use, reproduction, modification, publication, display, or other exploitation of any of the content 

that the participant submits; and 6) the content the participant submits does not contain any viruses, 

Trojan horses, worms, or other disabling devices or harmful code.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7>By posting or submitting a hackathon entry to the Contest (regardless of the form or medium of such

content), the participant hereby grants the hackathon and its sponsors, their respective affiliates, their 

affiliates' agents, and third-party contractors a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and 

license, with the right to sublicense, discuss, publicize, market, and otherwise display content derived 

from or relating to the hackathon entry ("Marketing Content"), and to distribute and use such Marketing 

Content for promotional and marketing purposes either in the form submitted or in the form of a derivative 

or adapted work. The participant understands that he or she will not receive any compensation or credit 

for use of your hackathon entry, other than what is described in these Official Contest Rules.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7><em>Copyright</h7></em></p></br>
<p><h7>The participant represents and warrants that he or she is the sole author and copyright owner of the 

submission, and that the submission is the participant’s original work. If the submission is a work based 

on an existing application, the participant warrants: 1) that he or she has acquired sufficient rights to use 

and to authorize others to use the submission as specified in the “Intellectual Property Rights” section of 

the Rules, 2) that the Submission does not infringe upon any copyright or upon any other third-party rights 

of which the participant is aware, and 3) that the submission is free of malware.</p></h7></br>

<p><h5>IV. General</h5></p>
<p><h7><em>Eligibility</h7></em></p></br>
<p><h7>The hackathon organizers will have the right at their sole discretion to determine whether an entrant is 

eligible for the Contest. The hackathon may disqualify entries that: 1) are in violation of third-party rights, 

law, or regulation, 2) use inappropriate or explicit language or images, or 3) display content that the 

hackathon or its sponsors otherwise finds objectionable or inconsistent with the hackathon’s or its 

sponsors' brand image or goodwill.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7>The hackathon will accept only those entries that are completed and submitted as described above and 

that conform to any technical requirements specified as part of the entry process. Entries that do not 

comply with the provisions of these Official Contest Rules will be deemed ineligible and will not be 

considered.</p></h7></br>

<p><h7><em>Winner Selection/Judging Criteria</h7></em></p></br>
<p><h7>The contest winners will be selected by the sponsor of each prize, in each sponsor’s sole discretion.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7>By submitting any hackathon entry, entrants release the hackathon, its sponsors, their respective 

subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, and advisors from any and 

all liability for any claims, costs, injuries, losses, or damages of any kind arising out of or in connection 

with the sponsors’ decisions.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7><em>Awards</em></p></h7></br>
<p><h7>Contest prizes are non-transferable by the winner. Accepting a prize makes the prize recipient solely 

responsible for all applicable taxes related to accepting such prize.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7><em>Conduct</em></p></h7></br>
<p><h7>By entering this contest, participants agree to be bound by this policy. To the maximum extent permitted 

by law, the hackathon reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Participants further agree to be 

bound by the decisions of the hackathon and the sponsors which shall be final and binding in all respects. 

The hackathon reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual that violates this or any 

other hackathon policy, and acts in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner with intent to annoy, abuse, 

threaten, or harass any other person.</p></h7></br>
<p><h7>Please report any incidents or concerns to the event staff.</p></h7></br></br></br>
